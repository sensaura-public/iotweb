[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/gj9dhvwn5oss2qsn/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ummarbhutta/iotweb/branch/master)

This is a Fork of [IoTWeb] (https://github.com/sensaura-public/iotweb), and includes following bug fixes
* [HttpHandler was not being called for POST methods] (https://github.com/sensaura-public/iotweb/issues/6)
* Websocket handshake issue on Safari 10.0.1 (11602.2.14.0.7) with Invalid HTTP version string: HTTP/1.0 error.

The IotWeb class library allows you to embed a simple HTTP and WebSocket server into your C# application. The library supports both the .NET 4.5 framework as well as the Universal Windows Platform allowing you to target [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/), Windows Desktop and [Windows 10 IoT Core](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot).

The library is released under the [Creative Commons BY-SA license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) - this means you can use the library in commercial and non-commercial projects as long as you provide attribution (a link to this page will be fine) and release any changes you make under the same license.

The full source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/sensaura-public/iotweb), please raise any bug reports or feature requests on the [issues page](https://github.com/sensaura-public/iotweb/issues) for the project.

You can install the library [using NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IotWeb/). Be aware that the NuGet package will lag behind the source repository, only stable updates will be released.
