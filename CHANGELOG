V0.8.6 - January 17, 2016

* Changed IServer/ISocket server interface to take the port number as a parameter
  in the constructor rather than on the Start() method. This makes it more
  generic (and simplifies the integration with SensHub).
* Added support for sending binary WebSocket frames (requested on Slack).
* Changed filter interface to support before and after filter hooks. This makes
  it easy to do things like time request handling and perform logging. Also
  allows for custom HTTP error pages.
